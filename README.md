The program in `graph.py` contains code that is used to analyse the rest of the data in this folder, and produce graphs. To use the progarm, please change the function called at the bottom of the file to the type of graph that you wish to prodcue. The program will also zero the graph to the baseline of the data, and trim the data to an appropriate length.
